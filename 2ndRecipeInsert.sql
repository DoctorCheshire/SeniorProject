BUNS
In a mixing bowl, combine flour, instant yeast, sugar and salt. Add about 120 ml / ½ cup of warm (that’s 
important) water and 1½ tbsp of oil. Once combined roughly with a wooden spoon, start combining the dough 
with your hands. It will need a bit more water but it is very important to add the water in gradually, 
tablespoon by tablespoon. In my experience it takes another 2-3 tablespoons of water to achieve a dough 
that is not too dry or not too sticky. Knead it for 10 minutes with your hands until elastic and smooth. 
Form the dough into a ball and rub a small amount of oil on the dough’s surface to prevent drying. Place 
in a clean bowl covered with a kitchen towel and place it somewhere warm (but not too warm, sticking it 
too close to a fireplace is a bad idea, for example) for 1-2 hrs or until it doubles in size.
Cut two circles (if you have a two tier bamboo steamer) of baking paper to line the steamer with. Make a 
lot of small holes in the circles so that the steam can get through. You can use a paper puncher for this 
or fold each circle in half 3 times and cut small circles out along the folded edges with a pair of 
scissors. Prepare also eight 5 cm / 2″ squares of baking paper and insert into the buns to prevent the 
two halves from sticking to each other (you could also use oil instead).
After the dough has doubled in size, tip it out onto a lightly floured surface and press the air our with 
your fingertips. Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces and form small balls. Place the balls on a lightly 
floured surface, cover with a kitchen towel and leave for another 30 min. Using a rolling pin, roll the 
balls out into ½ cm / ¼” thick oval shapes. Fold each shape in half and insert a square of baking paper 
between the two halves. Alternatively you could also oil the buns before folding in half. Line your bamboo 
steamer with paper circles you’ve made earlier and place folded up buns inside for another 30 min of 
proving. If your steamer is too small (like mine), place four buns inside (two on each tier) and rest 
the remaining four on a baking paper lined and lightly dusted tray until you are ready to steam. Half 
fill a pot (which the steamer can comfortably sit on, of course) with water and place the steamer with 
the buns on top. Whack the heat to medium-high (I used setting 4 out of 6) and let the water come to a 
simmer – don’t be tempted to peak inside or you will ruin the buns. Once you can hear the water simmering 
vigorously, put the timer on to 10 mins. After the time is up, take the pot and steamer off the heat and 
rest the buns for another 5 minutes. This will spare the buns temperature shock   and will prevent them 
from shrinking. After 5 minutes, lift the lid off and remove the buns gently. Cook the remaining four like 
you did the first four.
FILLING
Open the can of jackfruit and drain it. Cut the firm, pointy ends off each triangular piece of jackfruit 
(you can still use them if you wish) and squash each piece of jackfruit gently so that it separates into 
individual strands and soaks up more of the cooking sauce. Set aside. Heat up 2 tbsp of oil in a medium 
size pan. Fry spring onions until softened. Add chopped garlic and ginger and fry gently until soft and 
fragrant. Mix in Chinese five spice and fry gently for one minute. Now add the remaining sauce 
ingredients: tamari / soy sauce, hoisin sauce, rice vinegar and sugar. Mix them around well, allow sugar 
to melt. Finally add in jackfruit and mix well to allow it to warm up and soak up the maximum amount of 
sauce. Fill each bun with pulled jackfruit, fresh veggies, herbs, chilli, crushed peanuts and some extra 
hoisin sauce.');

well covered with the starch powder.) - Pour some cooking oil into a deep saucepan/wok and heat until it 
reaches 175 C/ 347 F (or boiling).- Deep fry the rice cakes in batches until the outer layer turns crispy 
(under 30 seconds to avoid possible rice cake explosion). Take them out and set aside onto kitchen paper 
to absorb any excess oil. Repeat this with the remaining rice cakes. - Deep fry the battered chicken 
pieces in batches until golden and cooked through (2 to 3 mins). Take them out and set aside onto kitchen 
paper to absorb any excess oil. Repeat this with the remaining chicken. (Don’t put too much chicken in 
one go as it can lower the oil temperature down.) To make the chicken extra crunchy, double fry them one 
more time. Set aside. Pour the sauce into a heated skillet. Bring it to boil on medium heat until the 
sauce thickens a little bit (1 to 2 mins). Stir constantly. Add the double fried chicken and coat with the 
sauce quickly and thoroughly. Garnish with your choice of toppings (e.g. crushed nuts, seeds and green 
onion). Serve.');
