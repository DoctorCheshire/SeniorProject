Add about 120 ml / ½ cup of warm (that’s \r\nimportant) water and 1½ tbsp of oil. Once combined roughly with a wooden spoon, start combining the dough \r\nwith your hands. It will need a bit more water but it is very important to add the water in gradually, \r\ntablespoon by tablespoon. In my experience it takes another 2-3 tablespoons of water to achieve a dough \r\nthat is not too dry or not too sticky. Knead it for 10 minutes with your hands until elastic and smooth. \r\nForm the dough into a ball and rub a small amount of oil on the dough’s surface to prevent drying. Place \r\nin a clean bowl covered with a kitchen towel and place it somewhere warm (but not too warm, sticking it \r\ntoo close to a fireplace is a bad idea, for example) for 1-2 hrs or until it doubles in size.\r\nCut two circles (if you have a two tier bamboo steamer) of baking paper to line the steamer with. Make a \r\nlot of small holes in the circles so that the steam can get through. You can use a paper puncher for this \r\nor fold each circle in half 3 times and cut small circles out along the folded edges with a pair of \r\nscissors. Prepare also eight 5 cm / 2? squares of baking paper and insert into the buns to prevent the \r\ntwo halves from sticking to each other (you could also use oil instead).\r\nAfter the dough has doubled in size, tip it out onto a lightly floured surface and press the air our with \r\nyour fingertips. Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces and form small balls. Place the balls on a lightly \r\nfloured surface, cover with a kitchen towel and leave for another 30 min. Using a rolling pin, roll the \r\nballs out into ½ cm / ¼” thick oval shapes. Fold each shape in half and insert a square of baking paper \r\nbetween the two halves. Alternatively you could also oil the buns before folding in half. Line your bamboo \r\nsteamer with paper circles you’ve made earlier and place folded up buns inside for another 30 min of \r\nproving. If your steamer is too small (like mine), place four buns inside (two on each tier) and rest \r\nthe remaining four on a baking paper lined and lightly dusted tray until you are ready to steam. Half \r\nfill a pot (which the steamer can comfortably sit on, of course) with water and place the steamer with \r\nthe buns on top. Whack the heat to medium-high (I used setting 4 out of 6) and let the water come to a \r\nsimmer – don’t be tempted to peak inside or you will ruin the buns. Once you can hear the water simmering \r\nvigorously, put the timer on to 10 mins. After the time is up, take the pot and steamer off the heat and \r\nrest the buns for another 5 minutes. This will spare the buns temperature shock   and will prevent them \r\nfrom shrinking. After 5 minutes, lift the lid off and remove the buns gently. Cook the remaining four like \r\nyou did the first four.\r\nFILLING\r\nOpen the can of jackfruit and drain it. Cut the firm, pointy ends off each triangular piece of jackfruit \r\n(you can still use them if you wish) and squash each piece of jackfruit gently so that it separates into \r\nindividual strands and soaks up more of the cooking sauce. Set aside. Heat up 2 tbsp of oil in a medium \r\nsize pan. Fry spring onions until softened. Add chopped garlic and ginger and fry gently until soft and \r\nfragrant. Mix in Chinese five spice and fry gently for one minute. Now add the remaining sauce \r\ningredients: tamari / soy sauce, hoisin sauce, rice vinegar and sugar. Mix them around well, allow sugar \r\nto melt. Finally add in jackfruit and mix well to allow it to warm up and soak up the maximum amount of \r\nsauce. Fill each bun with pulled jackfruit, fresh veggies, herbs, chilli, crushed peanuts and some extra \r\nhoisin sauce.'),

Work the butter pieces \r\ninto the flour with your fingers until the mixture becomes coarse and sandy. Add the egg yolk and the \r\nwhite wine and mix until it becomes a smooth dough. Spread a piece of plastic wrap on a flat surface and \r\nplace the dough in the center. Wrap the plastic loosely around it and press the dough to fill the gap. \r\nFlattening the dough will mean less rolling later. Let it rest in the fridge for a few minutes while you \r\nmake the filling.\r\nFor the filling: In a medium bowl, whisk the ricotta until smooth. Sift in the powdered sugar, cinnamon \r\nand allspice. Mix to blend. In a separate bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the \r\nwhisk attachment), beat the heavy cream until fairly stiff. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold the \r\ncream into the ricotta mixture. Stir in the chocolate chips. Lightly zest the exterior of the lemon and \r\nstir it into the ricotta. Refrigerate for a half hour to an hour.\r\nTo roll and fry the shells: In a medium pot with a heavy bottom, heat the canola oil to 360 degrees F. \r\nMeanwhile, sift an even layer of flour on a flat surface. Flour a rolling pin. Roll the dough until it is \r\nvery thin (about 1/8-inch thick). Cut the dough into fourths and work in small batches. Use any glass or \r\nsmall bowl that has a 3-to-4-inch diameter. Cut rounds, tracing around each one to assure the dough has \r\nbeen fully cut. You should have about 24 circles. Wrap each circle around a cannoli mold. Use a little \r\nof the egg wash on the edge of each round to seal it shut and to assure it will not slide or fall off the \r\nmold before pressing it closed over the mold. Flare the edges out slightly from the mold. Flaring will \r\nallow the oil to penetrate each cannoli shell as they fry. Use a pair of tongs to hold the edge of the \r\nmold as you submerge and fry the shell in the oil until crispy, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the oil, and \r\nholding the mold in one had with your tongs, gently grip the shell in your other hand with a kitchen \r\ntowel and carefully slide it off the mold. Set aside to cool. Repeat with all of the circles.\r\nTo fill the cannolis: Just before serving, use a pastry bag without a tip to pipe the ricotta into the \r\ncannoli molds. Fill the cannoli shells from both ends so the cream runs through the whole shell. Dust \r\nwith powdered sugar. Powdered sugar gives that little extra sweetness and added texture to the exterior. It also makes me feel like I have a professional bakery touch in my own home. Serve immediately.\r\nCook’s Note\r\nIf the ricotta has an excess of liquid, drain it over a strainer for at least a half an hour before making \r\nthe filling. Make and fry the shells and the filling. Do not fill the shells with the cream until you are \r\nready to eat them. Everyone loves a crispy cannoli.'),

Add about 120 ml / ½ cup of warm (that’s \r\nimportant) water and 1½ tbsp of oil. Once combined roughly with a wooden spoon, start combining the dough \r\nwith your hands. It will need a bit more water but it is very important to add the water in gradually, \r\ntablespoon by tablespoon. In my experience it takes another 2-3 tablespoons of water to achieve a dough \r\nthat is not too dry or not too sticky. Knead it for 10 minutes with your hands until elastic and smooth. \r\nForm the dough into a ball and rub a small amount of oil on the dough’s surface to prevent drying. Place \r\nin a clean bowl covered with a kitchen towel and place it somewhere warm (but not too warm, sticking it \r\ntoo close to a fireplace is a bad idea, for example) for 1-2 hrs or until it doubles in size.\r\nCut two circles (if you have a two tier bamboo steamer) of baking paper to line the steamer with. Make a \r\nlot of small holes in the circles so that the steam can get through. You can use a paper puncher for this \r\nor fold each circle in half 3 times and cut small circles out along the folded edges with a pair of \r\nscissors. Prepare also eight 5 cm / 2? squares of baking paper and insert into the buns to prevent the \r\ntwo halves from sticking to each other (you could also use oil instead).\r\nAfter the dough has doubled in size, tip it out onto a lightly floured surface and press the air our with \r\nyour fingertips. Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces and form small balls. Place the balls on a lightly \r\nfloured surface, cover with a kitchen towel and leave for another 30 min. Using a rolling pin, roll the \r\nballs out into ½ cm / ¼” thick oval shapes. Fold each shape in half and insert a square of baking paper \r\nbetween the two halves. Alternatively you could also oil the buns before folding in half. Line your bamboo \r\nsteamer with paper circles you’ve made earlier and place folded up buns inside for another 30 min of \r\nproving. If your steamer is too small (like mine), place four buns inside (two on each tier) and rest \r\nthe remaining four on a baking paper lined and lightly dusted tray until you are ready to steam. Half \r\nfill a pot (which the steamer can comfortably sit on, of course) with water and place the steamer with \r\nthe buns on top. Whack the heat to medium-high (I used setting 4 out of 6) and let the water come to a \r\nsimmer – don’t be tempted to peak inside or you will ruin the buns. Once you can hear the water simmering \r\nvigorously, put the timer on to 10 mins. After the time is up, take the pot and steamer off the heat and \r\nrest the buns for another 5 minutes. This will spare the buns temperature shock   and will prevent them \r\nfrom shrinking. After 5 minutes, lift the lid off and remove the buns gently. Cook the remaining four like \r\nyou did the first four.\r\nFILLING\r\nOpen the can of jackfruit and drain it. Cut the firm, pointy ends off each triangular piece of jackfruit \r\n(you can still use them if you wish) and squash each piece of jackfruit gently so that it separates into \r\nindividual strands and soaks up more of the cooking sauce. Set aside. Heat up 2 tbsp of oil in a medium \r\nsize pan. Fry spring onions until softened. Add chopped garlic and ginger and fry gently until soft and \r\nfragrant. Mix in Chinese five spice and fry gently for one minute. Now add the remaining sauce \r\ningredients: tamari / soy sauce, hoisin sauce, rice vinegar and sugar. Mix them around well, allow sugar \r\nto melt. Finally add in jackfruit and mix well to allow it to warm up and soak up the maximum amount of \r\nsauce.

Work the butter pieces \r\ninto the flour with your fingers until the mixture becomes coarse and sandy. Add the egg yolk and the \r\nwhite wine and mix until it becomes a smooth dough. Spread a piece of plastic wrap on a flat surface and \r\nplace the dough in the center. Wrap the plastic loosely around it and press the dough to fill the gap. \r\nFlattening the dough will mean less rolling later. Let it rest in the fridge for a few minutes while you \r\nmake the filling.\r\nFor the filling: In a medium bowl, whisk the ricotta until smooth. Sift in the powdered sugar, cinnamon \r\nand allspice. Mix to blend. In a separate bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the \r\nwhisk attachment), beat the heavy cream until fairly stiff. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold the \r\ncream into the ricotta mixture. Stir in the chocolate chips. Lightly zest the exterior of the lemon and \r\nstir it into the ricotta. Refrigerate for a half hour to an hour.\r\nTo roll and fry the shells: In a medium pot with a heavy bottom, heat the canola oil to 360 degrees F. \r\nMeanwhile, sift an even layer of flour on a flat surface. Flour a rolling pin. Roll the dough until it is \r\nvery thin (about 1/8-inch thick). Cut the dough into fourths and work in small batches. Use any glass or \r\nsmall bowl that has a 3-to-4-inch diameter. Cut rounds, tracing around each one to assure the dough has \r\nbeen fully cut. You should have about 24 circles. Wrap each circle around a cannoli mold. Use a little \r\nof the egg wash on the edge of each round to seal it shut and to assure it will not slide or fall off the \r\nmold before pressing it closed over the mold. Flare the edges out slightly from the mold. Flaring will \r\nallow the oil to penetrate each cannoli shell as they fry. Use a pair of tongs to hold the edge of the \r\nmold as you submerge and fry the shell in the oil until crispy, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the oil, and \r\nholding the mold in one had with your tongs, gently grip the shell in your other hand with a kitchen \r\ntowel and carefully slide it off the mold. Set aside to cool. Repeat with all of the circles.\r\nTo fill the cannolis: Just before serving, use a pastry bag without a tip to pipe the ricotta into the \r\ncannoli molds. Fill the cannoli shells from both ends so the cream runs through the whole shell. Dust \r\nwith powdered sugar. Powdered sugar gives that little extra sweetness and added texture to the exterior. It also makes me feel like I have a professional bakery touch in my own home. Serve immediately.\r\nCook’s Note\r\nIf the ricotta has an excess of liquid, drain it over a strainer for at least a half an hour before making \r\nthe filling. Make and fry the shells and the filling. Do not fill the shells with the cream until you are \r\nready to eat them. Everyone loves a crispy cannoli.'),

If they darken too \r\nquickly turn oven down to 350 degrees and bake for an additional 5 to 10 minutes.\r\nRemove loaves and cool on rack for at least 40 minutes before slicing and serving.\r\nRECIPE NOTES\r\nPlan Ahead: This authentic bread dough takes 2 days to prepare. This method gives you full flavored \r\nFrench bread with dough that has been pre-fermented. This allows the dough to have a nice open crumb and \r\ndelicious golden crust. \r\nThe methods described allow you to make it at home yet get it as close as possible to the French bread \r\nyou would find in your favorite bakery.'),

Sit until it resembles dough. Cover\r\nwith plastic wrap and let sit (dough will rise and fall) at room temperature for 6 to 24 hours.\r\nTo make the dough:\r\nCombine 3 cups bread flour and yeast in the bowl of your stand mixer. Using the dough hook, turn the \r\nmixer on low and slowly add the water while the mixer is running. Let this mix for 2 minutes until the \r\ndough starts to come together. Lift the head of your stand mixer and place a piece of plastic wrap \r\ntightly over the bowl. Let the dough rest for 20 minutes.\r\nAfter the 20 minute rest, remove the plastic wrap. Add the sponge and salt. Knead on medium/low speed for\r\n8 minutes. After 4 minutes, if the dough is sticking to the side of the bowl add the last 1/2 cup of \r\nflour a little at a time. The dough should slap the sides of the bowl but still stick to the bottom (you\r\ndo want it to stick to the bottom). Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and form into a smooth round ball.\r\nPlace the dough in a large, lightly oiled bowl, and cover tightly with greased plastic wrap. Let the \r\ndough rise in a warm spot until doubled, about an hour.\r\nAfter the dough has doubled, remove the plastic wrap. After the dough has risen for about an hour, it’s \r\ntime to start turning it. Slide a plastic bench scraper or rubber spatula under one side of the dough; \r\ngently lift and fold a third of the dough toward the center.Let rest for 30 minutes.\r\nRepeat the previous step after the 30 minutes are up and then let it rise for a second 30 minutes.\r\nAfter the second 30 minutes of rising, it’s time to form the loaf. Remove the dough from the bowl and \r\ngently press it into a 10-inch square. Gently dimple it. Fold each corner diagonally into the middle. \r\nUsing your fingertips and starting at the top of the dough, pull the underside of the dough up over the \r\ntop, stretching it considerably, and begin to roll the dough up into a rough log. With each roll, press \r\nthe seam firmly to seal. Continue to do this, forming the dough into a fairly tight log, 5 to 7 more times.\r\nPlace the dough, seam down, on a rimless baking sheet (or one that is upside-down) that is lined with \r\nparchment paper. Gently tuck the dough into place on the parchment. You should end up with a long thin \r\nloaf that is 16 inches long. Transfer dough to parchment lined inverted baking sheet or parchment lined pizza paddle.\r\nFinish shaping the loaf into a taut 16-inch-long torpedo-shaped loaf by tucking the edges under with your\r\nhands. Lightly mist the dough with oil and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise in a warm\r\nplace until doubled, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.\r\nWhile the dough is rising, prep the oven and your baking stone. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees. Let the\r\nbaking stone heat for 30 minutes (but not longer than an hour).\r\nWhen the dough has doubled, score the top with a razor blade, diagonally and 1/2 inch deep and spray \r\nlightly with water. Carefully slide the loaf and the parchment onto the hot baking stone in the oven. \r\nBake for 10 minutes.\r\nAfter 10 minutes reduce the oven temperature to 400 degrees. Bake for 30 to 35 more minutes until the \r\ncrust is a deep golden brown. Let the loaf cool completely on a wire rack until it is room temperature. \r\n(about 2 hours cooling time) Serve and enjoy'),
